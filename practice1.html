            <p>Mohamed Salah is one of the most prolific forwards in European football and a Champions League and Premier League winner with Liverpool</p>
            <p>The Egyptian has been an unstoppable scorer since joining the Reds from AS Roma in the summer of 2017, following up an historic 44-goal debut season with <a href="https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/352846-mohamed-salah-liverpool-top-scorer-2018-19" class="link">another 27 strikes in his second campaign at Anfield</a> after he had signed a new contract with the club in the summer of 2018.</p>
            <p>That latter tally included one in the Champions League final victory over Tottenham Hotspur in Madrid in June 2019, Salah smashing home a second-minute penalty en route to a 2-0 win for <a href="https://www.liverpoolfc.com/team/first-team/staff/jurgen-klopp" class="link">Jürgen Klopp’s</a> side</p>
            <p>Success at Estadio Metropolitano provided fitting redemption for the No.11, who was forced off with injury when Liverpool lost the previous year’s showpiece against Real Madrid.</p>
            <p>In 2019-20, Salah topped the team’s scoring charts with 23 strikes in all competitions as he helped the club lift their first FIFA Club World Cup and Premier League titles and, in October 2020, a typically-prolific start to the 2020-21 season saw him become the 17th player in Liverpool FC history to reach the landmark of 100 goals for the club.</p>
            <p>In the latter stages of the 2020-21 campaign, Salah reached the landmark of <a href="https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/434250-numbers-stats-mohamed-salah-first-200-games-liverpool" class="link">200 appearances</a>a for the club in a 4-2 victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford. Typically, he marked the occasion with a goal - his 30th of the season and 124th for the Reds overall.</p>
            <p>A talisman for his country, Salah quickly became a fan favourite at Anfield and formed part of a fearsome attacking trio with <a href="https://www.liverpoolfc.com/team/first-team/player/roberto-firmino" class="link">Roberto Firmino</a> and <a class="link" href="https://www.liverpoolfc.com/team/first-team/player/sadio-mane">Sadio Mane</a>.</p>

            <p>Salah won the Premier League Golden Boot in 2017-18 with 32 goals – a new record for a 38-game campaign – and retained the accolade the following season alongside teammate Mane and Arsenal’s Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.</p>
            <p>He was also named PFA Players’ Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year at the end of his first year with the Reds and carried his stellar form into a memorable 2018-19 that concluded with <a class="link" href="https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/352652-watch-video-liverpool-dressing-room-champions-league-final">a first piece of silverware of his Liverpool career</a>.</p>
            <p>The wide player, who has also been used in a more central position by Klopp on occasion, is capable of scoring a variety of goals, from spectacular long-range efforts to poacher’s finishes, as well as creating them too.</p>
